At Rithm there's a "company projects" section of the program. During this time, students get valuable experience working on a real world code base.   
   
_"Rithm School partners with professional engineering teams to provide our students with real-world experience during their time with us. This also helps partner companies execute important projects and product updates."_ [(Rithm)](https://www.rithmschool.com/company-projects)   
   
Needless to say, I was excited about getting to apply what I'd learned and contribute to something people were actually using. I was assigned to the group working on GIFsmos, an open source application overseen by the company Desmos.

Desmos is _"an advanced graphing calculator implemented as a web application." "Users can create accounts and save the graphs and plots that they have created to them."_ [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmos_(graphing)) In short, Desmos provides a free alternative to the overpriced calculators produced by companies like Texas Instruments.   
   
GIFsmos is the brainchild of Desmos developer Chris Lusto. [(GitHub)](https://github.com/ctlusto) The tool allows users to generate and download animated GIF images that illustrate how a graph may change over time. For example, a teacher could add a GIF to their lesson's slides ahead of time - rather than navigating to Desmos on the fly.   
   
Although Chris had written a fully functional application, it was still pretty bare bones at the time my group began working on it. We were all excited about getting a chance to make meaningful contributions to an open source project.
